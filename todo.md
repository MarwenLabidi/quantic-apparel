Data Visualizations: 
1. Bar Graph: Visualizing the number of trees across each arrondissement. ( NT : there is 20 arrondissement)
2. Pie Chart: Visualizing the percentage of trees that are considered "remarquable" in each arrondissement. 
3. Scatterplot: Visualizing the relationship between tree height and circumference.
   . Gather data on tree height and circumference. This data can be collected in the field or gathered from existing studies.

   . Enter the data into a spreadsheet or database program. 

   . Create a scatterplot, with tree height on the x-axis and circumference on the y-axis.

   . Add a linear regression line to the scatterplot. This will help to visualize the relationship between tree height and circumference. 

   . Interpret the data. The slope of the regression line indicates the strength of the relationship between tree height and circumference. If the slope is positive, that indicates that an increase in tree height is associated with an increase in circumference. If the slope is negative, that indicates that an increase in tree height is associated with a decrease in circumference. The R2 value indicates the strength of the relationship. A higher R2 value indicates a stronger relationship.



Useful Interactions: 
1. Filters: Allowing users to filter the data based on tree species, date of planting, and other factors. 
2. Hover Tooltip: Allowing users to hover over a data point to view more detailed information on a tree. 
3. Sorting: Allowing users to sort the data by height, circumference, date of planting, etc.
